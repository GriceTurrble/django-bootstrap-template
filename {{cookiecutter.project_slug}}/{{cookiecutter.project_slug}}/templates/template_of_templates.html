{% raw %}{% extends "base.html" %}

Making a new template? Copy the blocks from this file, then fill in your details as needed.
Be sure the `extends` tag remains the first line in the file, as Django requires.
And feel free to remove blocks you don't need to change.

By the way, notice how this text is not shown on the page?
When you extend a template, all content not in some `block` tag will be excluded.

{# Or you can use Django comment tags for safety #}

{% block head_extra_meta %}{# <meta> tags go here #}{% endblock %}

{% block head_css %}{# additional <link> tags for CSS #}{% endblock %}

{% block head_js %}{# <script defer> tags for deferred JS only #}{% endblock head_js %}

{% block head_title %}{# Page title. Base page has " | {% endraw %}{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}{% raw %}"; follow this pattern for sub-page titling #}{% endblock %}

{% block body_container_classes %}{# Add classes to the main <div> wrapping body content #}{% endblock %}

{% block body_content %}
{# All your page content goes here! #}
{% endblock %}

{% block body_js %}
{# Inline or other types of JS <script> tags here. #}
{# Remember we've already got jQuery and Bootstrap bundle with Popper loaded. #}
{% endblock %}{% endraw %}
